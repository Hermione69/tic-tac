**What is tic-tac-toe also known as?**
+ Tic-tac-toe, also called noughts and crosses and many other names, is a paper and pencil game between two players, O and X, who alternate in marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 board. A player wins by getting three of their own marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.

**What is the aim of tic-tac-toe?**
+ Tic Tac Toe is traditionally played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid. Players take turns placing a mark in one of the cells of the grid. The goal of the game is **for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.**

+ Player with the 'X' mark starts first. The first player to place 3 marks in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row wins the game.
